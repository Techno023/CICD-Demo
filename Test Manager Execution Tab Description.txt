The Execution Tab allows us to view execution results and also we can execute test sets

After executing testsets, in the Execution Tab we can view detailed results, including
 
Pass/Fail Status: Quickly identify which test cases passed or failed.
Execution Time: Measure how long each test case took to execute.

Re-executing Tests
If a test case fails, we can easily re-execute it:
Select the failed test case and choose the Re-execute option.
 
We can download the execution report in two file format: Excel and PDF

We have option to generate the Insight Report, if the testsets got passed it give only overview and it got failed will give the overview,Common Errors,Error Patterns and Recommendations as well.
 
In the Project Setting Tab we have integration option where we can connect and synchronize various ALM tools.
Currently we have two to three options which is in the preview mode where like in future we will be getting more options.

In the Dashboard we can see the execution graph.
